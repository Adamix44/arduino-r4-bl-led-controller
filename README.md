# Arduino R4 WIFI BLE LED Controller
This project demonstrates a simple IoT system using:
- Arduino R4 WiFi
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- iOS app built with SwiftUI and CoreBluetooth

## Features
- BLE communication between Arduino and iOS
- LED ON/OFF control
- Clean SwiftUI interface
- Custom BLE service and characteristic

## Hardware
- Arduino R4 WiFi

## Software
- Arduino IDE
- Xcode
- SwiftUI
- CoreBluetooth

## How it works
1. Arduino advertises a BLE service
2. iOS app scans and connects
3. User toggles LED state
4. Arduino receives BLE command and controls LED
